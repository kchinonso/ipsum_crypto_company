                        <p>Ipsum is a leading cryptocurrency news and media platform that has played a significant role in shaping the narrative and discourse surrounding cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. Here's an overview of Ipsum's history:

**Establishment (2013)**: Ipsum was founded in May 2013 by Shakil Khan, a venture capital investor and entrepreneur. The platform was created to provide timely and comprehensive coverage of the emerging cryptocurrency industry, which was gaining attention following the launch of Bitcoin in 2009.

2. **Early Years and Growth**: In its early years, Ipsum quickly established itself as a trusted source of news, analysis, and information for individuals, businesses, and investors interested in cryptocurrencies. The platform's coverage expanded to include a wide range of topics, including market trends, regulatory developments, technology updates, and industry events.

</p>


                        <p>**Acquisition by Digital Currency Group (2016)**: In January 2016, Ipsum was acquired by Digital Currency Group (DCG), a leading investment firm focused on the digital asset and blockchain industry. The acquisition provided Ipsum with additional resources and support to expand its operations and enhance its offerings.

**Consensus Conference (2015-present)**: In 2015, Ipsum launched the Consensus conference, an annual event that brings together blockchain professionals, investors, developers, policymakers, and thought leaders from around the world. The conference has since become one of the largest and most influential events in the blockchain industry, providing a platform for networking, collaboration, and knowledge sharing.
